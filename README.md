# **Optimizing Search and Rescue (SAR) Ship Deployment**

This repository contains the code and analysis for a project aimed at optimizing Search and Rescue (SAR) ship deployment through data-driven approaches. By leveraging maritime traffic data, the project seeks to enhance SAR operations in nearshore and remote regions.

## **Overview**

The project integrates data extraction, visualization, and simulation techniques to develop optimal SAR resource deployment strategies. Key components include:

- **Data Processing**: Extracted and processed ship density datasets from the Global Maritime Traffic Database (GMTDS) using Python.
- **Visualization**: Developed heatmaps, histograms, and other visual tools to analyze ship density patterns across different grid sizes.
- **Simulation**: Implemented mathematical models in MATLAB to simulate SAR operations and evaluate deployment strategies.

## **Objectives**

The primary goal of this work is to improve SAR efficiency by:

- Identifying high, medium, and low-density regions for resource prioritization.
- Optimizing deployment strategies to reduce response times and improve coverage.
- Supporting decision-making through visual analytics and simulation outputs.

## **Scope**

This project focuses on:

- Analyzing maritime traffic data within specific geographic regions.
- Evaluating the impact of grid size on operational efficiency and spatial distribution analysis.
- Excluding real-world validation due to current project constraints.

## **Technologies**

- **Python**: For data extraction and pre-processing.
- **MATLAB**: For data analysis, visualization, and simulation.

## **Future Work**

Recommendations for future enhancements include:

- Integrating additional datasets to refine models.
- Extending analysis to account for environmental factors and fleet capabilities.
- Conducting real-world validation through field testing of deployment strategies.

## **Contributions**

This project is part of **Work Package 3 (WP3)** under the **Future Ocean and Coastal Infrastructures (FOCI)** project. It highlights interdisciplinary collaboration with academic, government, and industry partners to address challenges in remote SAR operations.
